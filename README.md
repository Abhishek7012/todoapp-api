To create a brief README.md for your application, you can follow the structure below:

# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. It retrieves tasks from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API and allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd client 
      ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Interacting with the JSONPlaceholder API

The application interacts with the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch, add, update, and delete tasks. The API used in this application is `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`.

- **Fetching Tasks:** The initial tasks are fetched from the API when the application loads.

- **Adding a Task:** Enter a new task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button. The new task will be added to the list, and a success message will be displayed.

- **Completing a Task:** Check or uncheck the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed or incomplete. The status will be updated both locally and on the server.

- **Deleting a Task:** Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list. The task will be deleted both locally and on the server.

## Additional Notes

- The application uses React, Axios for HTTP requests, and React-Spring for animations.

- Loading indication is displayed while tasks are being fetched from the API.

- Error messages are displayed in case of issues with adding, updating, or deleting tasks.

Feel free to explore and enhance the application further based on your requirements!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
